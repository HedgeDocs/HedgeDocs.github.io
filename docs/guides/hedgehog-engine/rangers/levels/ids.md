# Level ID Map

## Mapping
### Worlds (Zones)

- w1 - Kronos
- w2 - Ares
- w3 - Chaos
- w5 - The End
- w6 - Green Hill
- w7 - Chemical Plant
- w8 - Sky Sanctuary
- w9 - Highway

### Stage Type
- r - Open Zone
- d - Cyber Space
- f - Fishing (always w1)
- h - Hacking (always w1)

## Oddities
Due to Ouranos and Rhea actually being part of Kronos, their map files are stored in w1:

- w1r04 - Ouranos
- w1r05 - Rhea (uses final Kronos terrain)

There are also various versions of Kronos in the game files (not present in the PC release), those being:

- w1r01 - Alpha Kronos (uses w1r02 terrain)
- w1r02 - Beta Kronos
- w1r03 - Final Kronos
