# Level ID Map

## Mapping
Stage IDs are defined like this:
```
{world_id}{stage_type}{stage_number}
```
!!! info "Example"
    w2r01 -> Ares Open Zone 1

### Worlds (Zones)

World ID | World Name
-------- | -----------
w1       | Kronos
w2       | Ares
w3       | Chaos
w5       | The End
w6       | Green Hill
w7       | Chemical Plant
w8       | Sky Sanctuary
w9       | Highway

### Stage Type

Stage Type ID | Stage Type
------------- | -----------
r             | Open Zone
d             | Cyber Space
f             | Fishing (always w1)
h             | Hacking (always w1)

## Oddities
Due to Ouranos and Rhea actually being part of Kronos, their map files are stored in w1:

- w1r04 - Ouranos
- w1r05 - Rhea (uses final Kronos terrain)

There are also various versions of Kronos in the game files (not present in the PC release), those being:

- w1r01 - Alpha Kronos (uses w1r02 terrain)
- w1r02 - Beta Kronos
- w1r03 - Final Kronos
