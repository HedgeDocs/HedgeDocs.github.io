Let\u2019s see what happens to Cast 0 (position, which usually is the parent of all casts in a scene and controls their position)...</p> <p></p> <p>Seems like we have flags! It\u2019s a bitfield, and it controls what actually animates in this cast. Here\u2019s the meaning of each bit: <pre><code>0000 0000(0) - Nothing\n0000 0001(1) - Hide Flag\n0000 0010(2) - X Position\n0000 0100(4) - Y Position\n0000 1000(8) - Rotation\n0001 0000(16) - X Scale\n0010 0000(32) - Y Scale\n0100 0000(64) - SubImage\n1000 0000(128) - Colour Mask\n</code></pre></p> <p>So, with this info, we now know what animates in the position cast: It is its X Position. The CastAnimationDataSubData1List is what stores the actual animation data. The amount of entries in this list depends on the number of bits signaled in the Flags field. The first entry in the list is referring to the first bit signaled from right to left. So by that logic, the list only has one entry.</p> <p></p> <p>And there we go. This entry is what stores the actual KeyFrames. Let\u2019s open one up to see how it is.</p> <p></p> <p>Scary right? I don\u2019t understand much of what\u2019s going on here, but here we go. </p> <p>Frame defines which global frame this keyframe is in. Remember AnimationFrameDataList? Yeah, this animation has a total of 10 frames, and is played at 60 FPS. For each frame, you define the global frame that it refers to. So, since this cast controls the position of the entire scene, and this is the intro animation, maybe the other keyframe has the frame field set to 10? We\u2019ll see about that shortly.</p> <p>Data store the data of this keyframe. The meaning of data changes depending on the flags. Data can be:</p> <ul> <li>A position</li> <li>An angle (for rotation)</li> <li>A size (for X and Y scale)</li> <li>An index (for SubImage)</li> <li>A colour (for ColorMask)</li> </ul> <p>According to the flags of this specific cast, these keyframes are supposed to control the X Position, which means that \u201cData\u201d actually represents the X Position of the cast in this frame.</p> <p>The Offset and Offset2 fields control the casts' Offset position value, where \"Offset\" is X, while \"Offset2\" is Y. For example, the buttons in the title screen of Sonic Generations use these values to stay in place when they're clicked since they get scaled up and down. Let\u2019s look at the second keyframe:</p> <p></p> <p>As we suspected, the Frame field is now set to 10, meaning this is referring to the last frame in the animation. The value in Data has increased, so this means that this cast slides from left to right in this animation!</p> <p>Looking at the remaining CastAnimationData entries, we can see that none of them animate, since their Flags field is set to 0. So we can conclude that Intro_Anim makes the position cast slide from left to right, and since \u201cposition\u201d controls the entire scene, every single cast from this scene slides from left to right in this animation!</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"guides/hedgehog-engine/blueblur/files/xncp/anims/#additional-notes","title":"Additional Notes","text":"<p>An animation can only be looped using code, so that can't be controlled via the XNCP.

To set these up, create an XML in your stage's cache directory called <code>groupdata_[x].group.xml</code> (where [x] is a name, such as <code>base</code>). Then lay them out as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>Each &lt;Group&gt; key is... Well... A Group that will be compiled into the converted SET.</p> <p>The &lt;Name&gt; key seems to just be for identification, so here (for Ocean Palace) I called it <code>CageGroup01</code> as it was the first group I made that unlocked a cage.</p> <p>The &lt;Type&gt; key is the name of the lua event that this group will activate, this key can be left empty if the group doesn't need to activate anything. In this example, it's called Cage01, so it will fire the event called Cage01 in the stage's lua file; which, as you can probably guess, signalled a cage to open.</p> <p>The &lt;ObjectCount&gt; key simply lists how many objects this group has (and honestly shouldn't have even been a thing, but I wrote this thing incredibly badly).</p> <p>The subkeys within the &lt;ObjectIDs&gt; key simply give the ID of an object that should be in this group.

In the Source SET, select your Generations <code>.set.xml</code> file from your stage's cache directory in your GLvl location (will be named <code>setdata_base.set.xml</code> by default). If you've created any groups for your object layout (which need to be made manually, see above), then select the approriate <code>groupdata_[x].group.xml</code> file for the Groups XML option, otherwise, leave it blank.</p> <p>For the GLvl Templates, select the <code>database\\objects</code> folder.</p> <p>Target SET is simply where you want to save the converted object placement to.</p> <p>Filtered Object Names will prevent the <code>Replace Object Names</code> option from overwriting objects that have any of the inputted values as part of their names.

This can also convert '06 groups into an XML if a Groups XML path is specified.</p> <p>Due to how Sonic GLvl handles object IDs, they will often not match with the IDs that '06 uses.
