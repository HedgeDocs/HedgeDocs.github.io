Windy Hill Final Original w1a01 w1a01 w1a03 w1a02 xind01 w1a03 w1a06 w1a04 w1a05 w1c01 w1a02 Starting off just like the final, it swiftly changes gears by heading into w1a02 instead of w1a03 . However, checking the description of the level (\u30a4\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u6d1e\u7a9f), it matches up with the final game's xind01 suggesting the two stages are one and the same, however the starting positions don't line up. xind01 w1a02 { -25.0, -43.3, 1328.6 } { 50.1, -10.55, -188.27 } w1a03 The following level is w1a03 , meaning Act 3 and Act 2 were likely swapped around early into development. w1a04 The order then continues with w1a04 , which is originally used as Sky Road Act 1. This suggests that this level was meant to be used in Windy Hill, which is supported by the fact that the level shares a very similar look with that area of the game. w1a05 w1a05 shares its description (\u30e2\u30a2\u30a4) with the level xmoa01 (Silent Forest Act 4) suggesting, just like the previous stage, it was to come much sooner into the game, however once again the starting positions don't line up. xmoa01 w1a05 { -720, 7070, 0 } { 80, 10067.96, 0 } Looking at xmoa01 's set data reveals a few leftover objects in the sky around w1a05 's spawn position. This list includes: 4x - ObjPointSoundSource 1x - ObjGiantMoaiOut 1x - ObjGFieldConstant 1x - EventVolumeCameraChange 1x - GPathCamera 1x - GoalRing 1x - SetRigidBody The spawn position being so close to the GoalRing means the level was more than likely supposed to start close to its end, though not meaning it was a short level as the Moai objects function as warp objects. w1c01 Finally for Windy Hill there's w1c01 . Taking note of the change from a to a c , it seems this level wasn't meant to be a normal act but a challenge level. Looking at the description (\u30ad\u30f3\u6597\u96f2) once again, it reveals to us that this level is non-other than xnim01 (Hidden World Act 1) from the final game, however once again there's a small difference in starting locations. xnim01 w1c01 { 0.00, -100.00,-10.00 } { 0.00, -95.00, 30.00 } Interestingly enough this leaves the final game's second encounter with Zazz in w1a06 nowhere to be seen. Desert Ruins Final Original w2a01 w2a01 xbee01 w2a02 xswe01 w2a03 w2a06 w2a04 w2a05 w2a06 w2c01 w2a02 Starting off just like the final, it swiftly changes gears by heading into w2a02 instead of xbee01 . However, checking the description of the level (\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30c1\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9), it matches up with the final game's xsky01 , suggesting the two stages are one and the same, however the starting positions don't line up. Interestingly enough this level also has the SKYCHASE tag, meaning it was a level where you controlled the Tornado just like the final iteration of the stage. xsky01 w2a02 { 0.0, 270.0, 17950.0 } { 2401.1, 63.06, 3125.81 } Test level stg823 has the following comment, which is about this level: w2-2\uff1a\u76f4\u5f8420\uff4d\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8 . This comment roughly translates to World 2-2: 20m Diameter Test . w2a03 This level sadly does not have a final counterpart in the release of the game. Its description roughly translates to Ancient City . w2a05 This level sadly does not have a final counterpart in the release of the game. Its description roughly translates to Japanese Spider Crab . w2a03 This level sadly does not have a final counterpart in the release of the game. Its description roughly translates to Sandworm Body . w2c01 w2c01 is the final level of the original order for Desert Ruins, but it's actually used as Sky Road Act 4 in the final game. The aesthetics of the area does match up with the look of Desert Ruins, so it's quite likely that this level was supposed to be there originally. The description for this level roughly translates to \"Yellow Triple Spring\", meaning it was very likely going to function like the Yellow Spring levels from Sonic Colors. This is supported by the fact that the Moving Springs in the level behave very similarly to the Yellow Springs in Sonic Colors. Tropical Coast From here on out the original level order becomes very segmented with barely any trace left of it. Final Original w3a01 w3a01 w3a03 xsea01 w3a03 w3a06 w6a03 w3a07 w3a07 This level sadly does not have a final counterpart in the release of the game. Its description is the same as w3a01 's with but it has a 2 at the end. Frozen Factory Final Original w4a01 w4a01 w4a04 w4a02 xcas01 w4a03 w4a06 w4a02 The second level instead of being w4a04 is w4a02 . However, checking the description of the level (\u30a4\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u6d1e\u7a9f2), it matches up with the final game's xind02 (Silent Forest Act 3) suggesting the two stages are one and the same, however the starting positions don't line up. xind02 w4a02 { 0.00, -49.99, 14663.00 } { -0.18, -52.03, -73.52 } w4a03 The third level instead of being xcas01 is w4a03 . However, checking the description of the level (ilomilo\u304a\u83d3\u5b50), it matches up with the final game's xswe01 (Desert Ruins Act 3) suggesting the two stages are one and the same, however the starting positions don't line up. xswe01 w4a03 { -590.76, 403.30, 1040.85 } { -1.08, 3.02, -3.30 } Inside the configuration file for the level xswe01 , the file is still called w4a03_config.lua , however the brief section states it's a configuration file for w2a05 . xswe01_config.lua --------------------------------------------------------------- -- @file w4a03_config.lua -- @author Jibiki_Hisae -- @brief w2-5 \u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb -- @data 2012/7/20 --------------------------------------------------------------- Silent Forest Final Original w5a01 w5a01 w5a02 xind02 xmoa01 Sky Road w6a03 The secret level of Tropical Coast in the final game. As most of Sky Roads levels seem to come from elsewhere, it's hard to make a proper judgement on whether the stage would aesthetically belong in Sky Road or not, it does however play very similarly to w6a05 , Sky Road's Act 3. The configuration file for the level does state that it belongs to Sky Road as well. w6a03_config.lua --------------------------------------------------------------- -- @file w6a03_config.lua -- @author Yoshitaka Miura -- @brief w6-3 \u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb -- @data 2012/10/30 --------------------------------------------------------------- w6a05 Inside the configuration file for the level xnim02 the brief section states it's a configuration file for w6a05 . xnim02_config.lua --------------------------------------------------------------- -- @file xnim02_config.lua -- @author Yoshitaka_Miura -- @brief w6-5 \u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb -- @data 2013/5/4 --------------------------------------------------------------- Speculative Additions This section includes educated guesses due to lack of leftover data from the game. Tropical Coast w3a02 , w3a04 , and w3c01 are nowhere to be seen. It's possible that these levels turned into one of the levels that don't start with the world number, or that they didn't exist to begin with. As the stage originally had a 7 th act it's possible that is what would have been the equivalent of w3c01 in this zone. w3a05 Test level w0a04 has the following comment, which is about this level: w3-5\uff1aSV\u30ab\u30b8\u30ce\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\uff08w0a04\uff09 . This comment roughly translates to World 3-5: Sideview Casino Test (w0a04) . This could mean that w3a05 turned into xcas01 later on into development, which is housed in Frozen Factory in the final game. Frozen Factory w4a05 and w4c01 are nowhere to be seen. It's possible that these levels turned into one of the levels that don't start with the world number, or that they didn't exist to begin with. Silent Forest w5a04 , w5a05 , w5a06 and w5c01 are nowhere to be seen.It's possible that these levels turned into one of the levels that don't start with the world number, or that they didn't exist to begin with. w5a03 The second level of Sky Road in the original game. The overall aesthetic of the level does match up with Silent Forest, which suggests it really did belong to Silent Forest at some point. Sky Road w6a01 , w6a02 , w6a06 and w6c01 are nowhere to be seen. It's possible that these levels turned into one of the levels that don't start with the world number, or that they didn't exist to begin with. Lava Mountain w7a04 , w7a05 and w7c01 are nowhere to be seen. It's possible that these levels turned into one of the levels that don't start with the world number, or that they didn't exist to begin with.","title":"Original Level Order"},{"location":"discoveries/sonic2013/levels/original-order/#original-level-order","text":"","title":"Original Level Order"},{"location":"discoveries/sonic2013/levels/original-order/#partial-original-order","text":"Up to a point the game's original level order can be revealed to us by investigating the game's leftover actstgdata.lua file. actstgdata.lua old_stage_all = { -- w1 { title = \"w1\u8349\u539f\" , stages = { { name = \"w1a01\" , title = \"w1-1:\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u30d2\u30eb\" , }, { name = \"w1a02\" , title = \"w1-2:\u30a4\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u6d1e\u7a9f\" , }, { name = \"w1a03\" , title = \"w1-3:\u6708\u5149\" , }, { name = \"w1a04\" , title = \"w1-4:\u5927\u30ca\u30fc\u30eb\u8ecd\" , }, { name = \"w1a05\" , title = \"w1-5:\u30e2\u30a2\u30a4\" , }, { name = \"w1c01\" , title = \"w1-A:\u30ad\u30f3\u6597\u96f2\" , }, }, }, -- w2 { title = \"w2\u7802\u6f20\" , stages = { { name = \"w2a01\" , title = \"w2-1:\u30b5\u30f3\u30c9\u30ef\u30fc\u30e0\u8ecd\" , }, { name = \"w2a02\" , title = \"w2-2:\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30c1\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9\" , }, { name = \"w2a03\" , title = \"w2-3:\u53e4\u4ee3\u90fd\u5e02\" , }, { name = \"w2a04\" , title = \"w2-4:\u30bf\u30ab\u30a2\u30b7\u30ac\u30cb\" , }, { name = \"w2a05\" , title = \"w2-5:\u30b5\u30f3\u30c9\u30ef\u30fc\u30e0\u4f53\u5185\" , }, { name = \"w2a06\" , title = \"w2-6:\u7adc\u5dfb\" , }, { name = \"w2c01\" , title = \"w2-A:\u9ec4\u8272\u4e09\u9023\u30d0\u30cd\" , }, }, }, -- w3 { title = \"w3\u5357\u56fd\" , stages = { { name = \"w3a01\" , title = \"w3-1:\u5357\u56fd\u30d3\u30fc\u30c1\" , }, { name = \"w3a03\" , title = \"w3-3:\u30d5\u30eb\u30fc\u30c4\u8fb2\u5712\" , }, { name = \"w3a07\" , title = \"w3-7:\u5357\u56fd\u30d3\u30fc\u30c12\" , }, }, }, -- w4 { title = \"w4\u96ea\" , stages = { { name = \"w4a01\" , title = \"w4-1:\u8ecd\u4e8b\u5de5\u5834\" , }, { name = \"w4a02\" , title = \"w4-2:\u30a4\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u6d1e\u7a9f2\" , }, { name = \"w4a03\" , title = \"w4-3:ilomilo\u304a\u83d3\u5b50\" , }, }, }, -- w5 { title = \"w5\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\" , stages = { { name = \"w5a01\" , title = \"w5-1:\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u8ecc\u9053\u65bd\u8a2d\" , }, }, }, } Many of these levels have been deleted.

In the screenshot above, we\u2019re seeing the data referring to Animation 0 ( Intro_Anim when following the dictionary). XNCPs usually follow this naming scheme for animations: Intro_Anim - Animation that plays when the scene appears Usual_Anim - Normally a looping animation, is used during the scenes visible state Outro_Anim - Played before the scene disappears They can obviously store other animations, and those have their own names. So, in Intro_Anim, we have several CastAnimationData . These control what happens to each cast in this animation. Let\u2019s see what happens to Cast 0 (position, which usually is the parent of all casts in a scene and controls their position)... Seems like we have flags! It\u2019s a bitfield, and it controls what actually animates in this cast. Here\u2019s the meaning of each bit: 0000 0000 - Nothing 0000 0001 - Unknown 0000 0010 - X Position 0000 0100 - Y Position 0000 1000 - Rotation 0001 0000 - X Scale 0010 0000 - Y Scale 0100 0000 - SubImage 1000 0000 - Colour Mask So, with this info, we now know what animates in the position cast: It\u2019s its X Position. The CastAnimationDataSubData1List is what stores the actual animation data. The amount of entries in this list depends on the number of bits signaled in the Flags field. The first entry in the list is referring to the first bit signaled from right to left. So by that logic, the list only has one entry. And there we go. This entry is what stores the actual KeyFrames . Let\u2019s open one up to see how it is. Scary right? I don\u2019t understand much of what\u2019s going on here, but here we go. Frame defines which global frame this keyframe is in. Remember AnimationFrameDataList ? Yeah, this animation has a total of 10 frames, and is played at 60 FPS. For each frame, you define the global frame that it refers to. So, since this cast controls the position of the entire scene, and this is the intro animation, maybe the other keyframe has the frame field set to 10? We\u2019ll see about that shortly. Data store the data of this keyframe. The meaning of data changes depending on the flags. Data can be: A position An angle (for rotation) A size (for X and Y scale) An index (for SubImage) A colour (for ColorMask) According to the flags of this specific cast, these keyframes are supposed to control the X Position, which means that \u201cdata\u201d actually represents the X Position of the cast in this frame. The Offset and Offset2 fields are unknown. They seem to offset the value in the Data field, but I don\u2019t know their actual meanings. I still don\u2019t know how animations loop, and if that\u2019s even defined in the XNCP. I\u2019d assume it\u2019s in some of these fields, but I\u2019m not sure. Maybe the game just keeps playing the animation and the XNCP doesn\u2019t control that? Anyway let\u2019s look at the second keyframe then: As we suspected, the Frame field is now set to 10, meaning this is referring to the last frame in the animation. The value in Data has increased, so this means that this cast slides from left to right in this animation! Looking at the remaining CastAnimationData entries, we can see that none of them animate, since their Flags field is set to 0. So we can conclude that Intro_Anim makes the position cast slide from left to right , and since \u201cposition\u201d controls the entire scene, every single cast from this scene slides from left to right in this animation! Hope I explained XNCP animations well enough. Have fun!

In this guide, I'll explain the general things you need to get started. Requirements First of all, you will need to download the 010 Editor . This program is used for hex editing, and in our case, to modify XNCP files. You'll also need to download the XNCP Template ; essentially, this file will make it so that you can read and understand the XNCP file's contents, otherwise you'd only see hex numbers, and that's not exactly readable. Opening an XNCP file After installing the 010 Editor, and downloaded the XNCP Template, it's time to open a file. Open the 010 Editor and click on File > Open File... , and open the file that you need to edit. After opening the file, you'll see a bunch of numbers. Don't get freaked out, this is normal. These are the contents of the XNCP file. Now, you need to go to Templates > Open Template... , and open the file that we downloaded before. It's called sonic_xncp_yncp.bt . After opening the file, a window should pop up with the template's code. You can just ignore this window and hide it wherever you'd like, you won't need to modify this. Now, go back to Templates and click on Run Template . This should now make the numbers have colorful backgrounds, and a new window will appear below the hex view. This new window that has appeared will be your workspace. This'll be the way in which you edit all aspects of a UI file. Click on the struct TFAPC File dropdown, then struct TFAPCEmbeddedRes Resources[0] , then struct TNNNCPJChunk CsdmProject , and then on struct TCSDNode Root . Now you'll have a few variables here; I'll explain what some of them mean! The structure of an XNCP file (Resource 0) Scenes are essentially the containers for a specific group of UI elements, think of it like a folder inside a folder, and you'll need SceneIDTable to understand which Scene is what. This table contains the name and index of each Scene (e.g: Scene \"gauge\" in ui_gameplay.xncp is the \"folder\" that contains all elements of the boost bar in the HUD). Scenes also have a few variables that may be of interest, like: ZIndex , this is essentially the layer in which the UI elements (known as Casts ) will render Groups , are exactly what they are called, they are groups of Casts SubImages , these are essentially textures that have been cut in specific portions to be used by Casts CastDictionary , this will be one of the most useful variables when editing XNCP files, these contain all the names, indexes, and group indexes needed to find a specific Cast in the scene. AnimationKeyFrameDataList , AnimationDictionary , AnimationFrameDataList , AnimationData2List , all of these control animations. You can read more about them here And the most important one of all: Casts , these are the UI elements of XNCP files, these contain the necessary data to display text, move other elements, or display an image. The structure of a Cast The Cast has several variables that you can change: Field04 controls the type of the cast, these types can be: 0 - No Draw (invisible) 1 - Sprite 2 - Font IsEnabled will enable and disable a cast. 0 for disabled and 1 for enabled Info If you're disabling a cast, make sure that it does not have children, or it might make the UI look weird! Field0C , Field14 , Field1C , Field24 change the positions of the corners of the cast, Top Left, Bottom Left, Top Right, Bottom Right respectively. These only really affect casts that render sprites Offset changes the position of the element relative to its parent. This is useful for moving elements around. Field30Data contains most of the fun things that you can edit in a Cast, like: Offset - confusingly, this is an actual offset, compared to the one before which is more like a position Rotation Scale Color - where the variable \"Color\" will change the main color of the image, and GradientTopLeft,BottomLeft,TopRight,BottomRight will change the colors of the corners of the image Field40Data contains data about a cast's subimages. If the cast is a nodraw or font type, this will be all set to -1 most of the time. Each of these variables is a holder for a specific index of a subimage. However, only the first one is used all the time, all of the other ones are for animations. The structure of an XNCP file (Resource 1) Before, I wrote that you needed to go into Resource 0. This is because Resource 0 has most of the cool stuff that you can edit, while Resource 1 contains data about image file locations. TextureList , this is a list of all the textures used by the UI... this is pretty much it. Each texture will have a name, and it's index will be the number specified next to the \"Textures\" name. This was a general introduction to XNCP files, and their structures.

This table contains the name and index of each Scene (e.g: Scene \"gauge\" in ui_gameplay.xncp is the \"folder\" that contains all elements of the boost bar in the HUD). Scenes also have a few variables that may be of interest, like: ZIndex , this is essentially the layer in which the UI elements (known as Casts ) will render Groups , are exactly what they are called, they are groups of Casts SubImages , these are essentially textures that have been cut in specific portions to be used by Casts CastDictionary , this will be one of the most useful variables when editing XNCP files, these contain all the names, indexes, and group indexes needed to find a specific Cast in the scene. AnimationKeyFrameDataList , AnimationDictionary , AnimationFrameDataList , AnimationData2List , all of these control animations. You can read more about them here And the most important one of all: Casts , these are the UI elements of XNCP files, these contain the necessary data to display text, move other elements, or display an image.","title":"The structure of an XNCP file (Resource 0)"},{"location":"guides/hedgehog-engine/blueblur/files/xncp/basics/#the-structure-of-a-cast","text":"The Cast has several variables that you can change: Field04 controls the type of the cast, these types can be: 0 - No Draw (invisible) 1 - Sprite 2 - Font IsEnabled will enable and disable a cast. 0 for disabled and 1 for enabled Info If you're disabling a cast, make sure that it does not have children, or it might make the UI look weird! Field0C , Field14 , Field1C , Field24 change the positions of the corners of the cast, Top Left, Bottom Left, Top Right, Bottom Right respectively. These only really affect casts that render sprites Offset changes the position of the element relative to its parent. This is useful for moving elements around. Field30Data contains most of the fun things that you can edit in a Cast, like: Offset - confusingly, this is an actual offset, compared to the one before which is more like a position Rotation Scale Color - where the variable \"Color\" will change the main color of the image, and GradientTopLeft,BottomLeft,TopRight,BottomRight will change the colors of the corners of the image Field40Data contains data about a cast's subimages. If the cast is a nodraw or font type, this will be all set to -1 most of the time. Each of these variables is a holder for a specific index of a subimage.

This guide will explain how to set up GLvl for this purpose, with the assumption that the user understands basic usage of the program itself. How to use Sonic GLvl with Sonic '06 Setting Up Download your preferred version of Sonic GLvl 0.9 and extract the repository to any location. Then, open the database folder and delete the objects folder. Next, download the Sonic '06 Stage Editing Archive and extract the SonicGLvl/database folder to your SonicGLvl location, choosing to merge/replace existing files. Converting Stage Terrain Pre converted copies of the actual Sonic '06 stages are present on the Stage Editing Archive repository (under the SonicGLvl/import directory). When converting your own terrain (such as for a stage mod) the process is almost identical to the conversion process for Sonic Generations (it's recommended to use the two #base files as a template). The crucial step is to remember to set the stage scale in HedgehogConverter to 1% on all three axis, as the scale does not match between both games. Usage The process of placing and editing objects at this point follows the workflow of using Sonic GLvl for a Generations stage mod, so will not be covered here. Groups Objects in '06 make frequent usage of grouping, allowing objects to influence each other in some way (such as an Egg Chaser commanding a squad of Egg Liners or defeating an enemy unlocking a cage). To set these up, create an XML in your stage's cache directory called groupdata_[x].group.xml (where [x] is a name, such as base ). Then lay them out as shown below. Each <Group> key is... Well... A Group that will be compiled into the converted SET. The <Name> key seems to just be for identification, so here (for Ocean Palace) I called it CageGroup01 as it was the first group I made that unlocked a cage. The <Type> key is the name of the lua event that this group will activate, this key can be left empty if the group doesn't need to activate anything. In this example, it's called Cage01, so it will fire the event called Cage01 in the stage's lua file; which, as you can probably guess, signalled a cage to open. The <ObjectCount> key simply lists how many objects this group has (and honestly shouldn't have even been a thing, but I wrote this thing incredibly badly). The subkeys within the <ObjectIDs> key simply give the ID of an object that should be in this group. These IDs are shown in the conversion log, and are also patched into the Generations SET if the Patch Generations SET option is used in the Converter (see below). '06 SET Conversion For converting between Generations and '06, we use the GLvl Converter. In the Source SET, select your Generations .set.xml file from your stage's cache directory in your GLvl location (will be named setdata_base.set.xml by default). If you've created any groups for your object layout (which need to be made manually, see above), then select the approriate groupdata_[x].group.xml file for the Groups XML option, otherwise, leave it blank. For the GLvl Templates, select the database\\objects folder. Target SET is simply where you want to save the converted object placement to. Filtered Object Names will prevent the Replace Object Names option from overwriting objects that have any of the inputted values as part of their names. This object is useful for group events where you're activating an object by its name. This converter can also convert from '06 to Generations by simply putting an '06 .set file as the source and a Generations .set.xml as the target. This can also convert '06 groups into an XML if a Groups XML path is specified. Due to how Sonic GLvl handles object IDs, they will often not match with the IDs that '06 uses. To correct this, choose the Patch Generations SET option, which will update the Generations .set.xml to show the correct IDs.","title":"Sonic GLvl"},{"location":"guides/others/marathon/levels/glvl/#how-to-use-sonic-glvl-with-sonic-06","text":"","title":"How to use Sonic GLvl with Sonic '06"},{"location":"guides/others/marathon/levels/glvl/#setting-up","text":"Download your preferred version of Sonic GLvl 0.9 and extract the repository to any location.
