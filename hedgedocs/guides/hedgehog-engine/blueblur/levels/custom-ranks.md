# How To Specify Custom Ranks for Sonic Generations

!!! info
    This guide requires the usage of decompiled LUA files, which can be obtained from the 2024 re-release of the game.

Rank times for all stages are stored in `bb3/#Application.ar.00/ScoreTimeTable.lua`. Opening this file presents you with a list with the A and C rank times (in seconds). The S rank is just the A rank time with a perfect bonus, and the D rank is any time below the C rank time.

## Example
Let's try editing the times for Seaside Hill (Modern). First we need to locate `ssh200`, as that's the codename for the stage.

```lua
ScoreTimeTable["ssh200"] = { 220,  820 }
```

Looking at this, we can see that the A rank for this stage is defined as 220 seconds (3 minutes and 40 seconds), and the C rank is defined as 820 seconds (13 minutes and 40 seconds). So, if we want to change the A rank time to 100 seconds, we can do this:

```lua
ScoreTimeTable["ssh200"] = { 100,  820 }
```

After editing the time, we save the file, repack the AR archive, and try it out in-game!
